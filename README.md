Welcome to the Genshin Build Planner's repository.

This is a webapp created to help with optimizing character builds in the gacha game [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/home).

## Features

- ### Artifacts, Weapons, and Characters with their corresponding stats
- ### Real time calculations for the total stats of the selected build
- ### Intuitive UI
- ### Build saving and sharing

## Current tech stack

- ### React
- ### Styled Components

# Refactor

This code is an absolute mess. Anyone can tell that.

So I plan to refactor it.

## New tech stack

- ### Next.js
- ### Redux
- ### Styled Components
- ### Typescript

# Contributing

If you somehow manage to compreehend this code (I don't), or wanna help with refactoring, feel free to open a pull request.
